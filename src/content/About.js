			<p>
				Hi! I'm Kierra, a Computer Science student at Carleton University, specializing in Cybersecurity with a minor in Psychology. 
				I am passionate about the intersection of cybersecurity, digital forensics, and software development. With a multidisciplinary mindset, I enjoy tackling challenges that blend technical depth with human-centered thinking.

				When I'm not busy with school or work, I can be found weightlifting at the gym, out in nature, or exploring the city! 
				On quieter days, I love curling up with my cat and a good show.
